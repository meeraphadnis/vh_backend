Dear Student,
Congratulations! Based on the information that you have supplied, we are pleased to provide you with this estimated
financial aid award letter. Your award package is an estimate based on your projected enrollment status for the
above-referenced academic year and is subject to change due to variety of factors, some of which are detailed below.
To receive federal student loans, you must be enrolled at least half-time – which generally means taking at least six
credit hours during a term. Please consult with a Financial Aid Officer if you add or drop classes or cease to be
enrolled at least half-time.

Your estimated financial aid award appears below.
*Note, if your estimated award includes loans, the federal government may charge you fees on those loans. The “Net
Amount” listed above reflects those fees (if applicable). The “Gross Amount” listed above is the actual amount you
will borrow before the fees are deducted (if applicable).
If this estimated award letter includes federal student loan(s), you have the right to decline, cancel, or reduce the
amount of the student loan(s). If you wish to borrow student loans, you must complete a Master Promissory Note
(MPN) so that loan funds may be disbursed to your account. You can complete the MPN at:
https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action
If you wish to decline, cancel, or reduce the amount of the student loan(s) you must notify the Financial Aid Office, in
writing, within 30 days of the date of this letter. You will be given another opportunity to decline funds at the time that
your student loans are disbursed. You should also notify the Financial Aid Office if you wish to apply to borrow
additional student loan funding. To determine your potential maximum loan eligibility (different from your
estimated award detailed above), see the chart below or refer to the section on loans in the Student
Consumer Information.
Awards will be applied to your tuition and fees for the payment periods in which you are enrolled. If your enrollment
status changes due to withdrawal, dismissal, graduation, or course load changes, such as adding/dropping classes,
your awards may be changed or cancelled. You must provide all required documents to the University to receive your
aid. In addition, you must maintain satisfactory academic progress as stated in the school catalog. You may be
required to submit additional documentation to verify certain data elements on your application.
Once the University applies your financial aid to your student account, any resulting credit balance will be refunded in
the manner you have authorized.
We wish you well in your studies. Please feel free to contact the Financial Aid Office if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Office of Financial Aid
